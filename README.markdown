# Zack (platformer game)

This is a platform game made for the course TDDD23 - Design and Programming of Computer Games at Link√∂ping University.

There are **6** tutorial levels and **3** real levels, including a *badass boss fight* in the end.

I have hade some trouble on some computers with certain setups, which makes the game run at a very low frame rate. Due to how the game is made, you really need to have 60 fps to have a good experience. I have had problem especially with MacBooks with Retina monitors. So make sure you can play the game in 60 fps.

There is a rather shitty screencast to go with the game:

Tell me what you think.

## Nomination

The game got nominated to the LiU Game Awards 2014 as a top 10 runner up of some 80 games, which was very exciting for me.
